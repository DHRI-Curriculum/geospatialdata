# Failure and DH tools: It's not working!  

* ["It Doesn't Work:" Failure and DH Tools (video)](https://univr.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2b012f49-5821-411f-bbb3-abf800f3eb54)

* "But let’s first talk about DH tools, and the ways they “don’t work”. One thing I’ve learned, over my years of doing direct end-user support, is that — what it is that “doesn’t work” often depends on your perspective."

-------

## What are the types of tools available?
* What is it you are trying to do? Does a tool exist for your particular need?  
* **Activity:** If we look at a website for a particular tool, what assumptions did the tools' designers make about what users are trying to do?  
    * [Choose from this list of tools from Duke.](https://digitalhumanities.duke.edu/tools) 
    * Select one of the tools to consider its possibilities.
        * What does it do?  
        * How does it do it? 
        * What was it designed for? 
        * How might it be limited? 
        * How might we expand past those limitations? 

## How to evaluate a tool
* How do you assess what the tools does, and what the tool needs from you to work? 
* Just as we discussed computers being very literal, tools are also very literal. What we might call failure may be a mismatch between a user's expectations and a tool’s construction. 
* How might you choose and assess a tool?
* What are you trying to do? *This will dictate your selection.*  
* Just as we looked at a project website to see how they did their project, we will now do that with a DH tool website.
    * What do they say in their documentation?
    * What is the tool set up to help the user do?
    * Does it do what you want? If not, why? Can you find a tool that does?

## How to plan around your tools 
* Given the affordances and limitations of the tool we discussed, how does it impact what you can do? 
* If you approach he tool or methodology first, you might have to modify other parts of you project to fit the tool. 
* Conversely, something with the capacity for a lot of customization might be more than you need. 
* What are you trying to do? What is your goal in regards to learning curve/output/publications?  

## How do you approach choosing a tool for classroom use? 
* How do you create an accurate mental model of a tool ?
