# Tool for mapping 
* What kinds of data are you working with? 
* Geospatial Data 
* There are many tools for working with geospatial data. What is your end goal? 
* Is it important to your project that you analyze your data (processing and/or manipulating your data) or so you just want to create a map/visualization? (presentation of your data).

# What is geospatial data?
* ["Spatial literacy is the competent and confident use of maps, mapping, and spatial thinking to address ideas, situations, and problems within daily life, society, and the world around us.](https://www.smu.edu/libraries/fondren/services/gis) 
    * Diana Stuart Sinton, Cornell University & Executive Director of the University Consortium for Geographic Information Science (UCGIS)
* What does [GPS](https://www.gps.gov/) stand for?
* Who uses Geospatial Data?
* "..geographic data is data with implicit or explicit reference to a location relative to the Earth"[via Geolexica](https://www.geolexica.org/concepts/202/)
* Why would it matter to me in the humanities?

# When do you choose to use a DH tool or progrmaming?
In this session we are building on what we discussed in the previous data session.
* What assumptions have been built into the tool you are considering?
* How does it read your data? What kinds of data (metadata, administrative, geospatial) data is it looking at?  
* How does a DH tool create a Visualization? 
* For todays lesson, our goal is *to make a map.* 

# A tool for geospatial analysis: ARC-GIS
* ARC-GIS contains data *sources*, allows for *processing and analysis* of that data, and you can use it to create an *output* of maps. 

# A tool for mapping: Storymaps 
* [What does this tool allow you to do?](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/)
