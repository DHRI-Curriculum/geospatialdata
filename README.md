# Geospatial Data 
* A Foundational Approach to Digital Humanities Research

* As part of our welcome process, we’ll provide some of the history of the project, review the schedule,establish the objectives for the Institute, and ask participants to engage in an introductions and ice breaker activity. We’ll review the objectives and the schedule for the next few days, sort out pedagogical practices, and set our ambitious course for our time together. Everything we do throughout the institute is collaboratively and community-driven.

- Applied Knowledge Scenario/Context: Meet and greet. Stating goals, expectations, and motivations. Interest etc.

* Performance Indicator:
- Interaction will fellow attendees. Demonstrate an understanding that this is the start of a process and that community is essential for the performance of Digital humanities.
