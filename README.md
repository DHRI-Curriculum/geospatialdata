# Digital Projects, Research and Tools

We have been discussing different aspects and stages of digital scholarship projects. In this session we will discuss how you can find and assess tools.  

## Required before session
**Read the following post .**
* ***[eternal september of the digital humanities by Bethany Nowviskie](http://nowviskie.org/2010/eternal-september-of-the-digital-humanities/)***

## Broadly, you may have goals around: 
### Sources (data or other materials you want to analyze)
* Digital Humanities and Data
* Acquiring, Cleaning, and Creating Data
* Identify the differences between unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data.
* Distinguish between different file types, their definitions, and applications.
* Apply intellectual property rights to the downloading and sharing of data.
* Practice different ways of downloading or creating data.
### Processing (how can these resources be analyzed or prepared for analysis) 
* The Command Line (Python)
* Working with Tools (openrefine, Voyant)
### Presentation (how do you want to share your sources and your findings). 

## Goals: What is it you want to do?
* Where are you in the process? 
* Your goals and your constraints (limitations of time, money, expertise, etc.) will dictate your choices (topics, training, partners, tools . programming, etc.)

* In this example from Programming Historian, you can see how lessons fall into broard phases or categories.
