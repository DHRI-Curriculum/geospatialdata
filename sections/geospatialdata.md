# Tool for mapping 
* What kinds of data are you working with? 
* Geospatial Data 
* There are many tools for working with geospatial data. What is your end goal? 

## What is geospatial data
* ["Spatial literacy is the competent and confident use of maps, mapping, and spatial thinking to address ideas, situations, and problems within daily life, society, and the world around us.](https://www.smu.edu/libraries/fondren/services/gis)

* What does GPS stand for?
* Who uses Geospatial Data?
* Why would it matter to me in the humanities?

# When do you choose to use a DH tool or progrmaming?
In this session we are building on what we discussed in the previous data session.
* How is it reading data? 
* What assumptions have been built into the tool you are considering?
* What data/metadata/administrative data is it looking at?  
* How does a DH tool create a Visualization? 
* How does it read your data? What kinds of data (metadata, administrative, geospatial) data is it looking at?  
* For todays lesson, our goal is *to make a map.* 


# A tool for mapping: Storymaps
